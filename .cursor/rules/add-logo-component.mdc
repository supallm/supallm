# Add logo component

When you are asked to create a new logo in the frontend use these rules.

IMPORTANT: 

1. ask the user to provide the logo raw svg content and the logo name if not provided

2. create a logo file with the lowercased name in the logos directory at frontend/src/components/logos/<name>.tsx

3. Use the following template and make sure to :
- Update the component name with the actual Logo name 
- Adapt the raw svg so it's compatible with a React Component
- Keep the viewbox of the raw svg but expose the width and height as props

```tsx
import { FC } from "react";

export const LogoName: FC<{ width: number; height: number }> = ({
  width,
  height,
}) => {
  return (
    <svg
      width={width}
      height={height}
      
     ... the reste of the SVG
    </svg>
  );
};
```
